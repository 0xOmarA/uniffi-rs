//! [`RustFuture`] represents a [`Future`] that can be sent over FFI safely-ish.
//!
//! The [`RustFuture`] is parameterized by `T` which implements [`FfiConverter`].
//! Thus, the `Future` outputs of value of kind `FfiConverter::RustType`.
//! The `poll` method maps this `FfiConverter::RustType` to
//! `FfiConverter::FfiType` when the inner `Future` is ready.
//!
//! This type may not be instantiated directly, but _via_ the procedural macros,
//! such as `#[uniffi::export]`. A `RustFuture` is created, boxed, and then is
//! manipulated by (hidden) “assistant” functions, resp. `uniffi_rustfuture_poll` and
//! `uniffi_rustfuture_drop`. Because the `RustFuture` type contains a generic
//! parameter `T`, the procedural macros will do a monomorphisation phase so that
//! all the API has all their types statically known.
//!
//! # The big picture
//!
//! This section will explain how the entire workflow works.
//!
//! Let's consider the following Rust function:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[uniffi::export]
//! async fn hello() -> bool {
//!     true
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! I Rust, this `async fn` syntax is strictly equivalent to:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[uniffi::export]
//! fn hello() -> impl Future<Output = bool> { /* … */ }
//! ```
//!
//! Once this is understood, it becomes obvious that an `async` function
//! returns a `Future`.
//!
//! This function will not be modified, but new functions with a C ABI will be
//! created, as such:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! /// The `hello` function, as seen from the outside. It returns a “`Future`”, or
//! /// more precisely, a `RustFuture` that wraps the returned future.
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn _uniffi_hello(
//!     call_status: &mut ::uniffi::RustCallStatus
//! ) -> Option<Box<::uniffi::RustFuture<bool>>> {
//!     ::uniffi::call_with_output(call_status, || {
//!         Some(Box::new(::uniffi::RustFuture::new(async move {
//!             hello().await
//!         })))
//!     })
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The second generated function is the _poll function_:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! /// The function to poll the `RustFuture` returned by `_uniffi_hello`.
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn _uniffi_hello_poll(
//!     future: Option<&mut ::uniffi::RustFuture<bool>>,
//!     waker: Option<NonNull<::uniffi::RustFutureForeignWakerFunction>>,
//!     waker_environment: *const ::uniffi::RustFutureForeignWakerEnvironment,
//!     polled_result: &mut <bool as ::uniffi::FfiConverter>::FfiType,
//!     call_status:: &mut ::uniffi::RustCallStatus,
//! ) -> bool {
//!     ::uniffi::ffi::uniffi_rustfuture_poll(future, waker, waker_environment, polled_result, call_status)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Let's analyse this function because it's an important one:
//!
//! * First off, this _poll FFI function_ forwards everything to
//!   `uniffi_rustfuture_poll`. This later is generic, while the former has been
//!   monomorphised by the procedural macros.
//!
//! * Second, it receives the `RustFuture` as an `Option<&mut RustFuture<_>>`. It
//!   doesn't take ownership of the `RustFuture`! It borrows it (mutably). It's
//!   wrapped inside an `Option` to check whether it's a null pointer or not.
//!
//! * Third, it receives a _waker_ as a pair of a _function pointer_ plus its
//!   _environment_ if any: a null pointer is purposely allowed for the environment.
//!   This waker function lives on the foreign language land. We will come back
//!   to it in a second.
//!
//! * Fourth, it receives an in-out `polled_result` argument, that is filled with the
//!   polled result if the future is ready (this part is subject to change).
//!
//! * Finally, the classical `call_status`, which is part of the calling API of `uniffi`.
//!
//! So, everytime this function is called, it polls the `RustFuture` after
//! having reconstitued a valid [`Waker`] for it. As said earlier, we will come
//! back to it.
//!
//! The last generated function is the _drop function_:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn _uniffi_hello_drop(
//!     future: Option<Box<::uniffi::RustFuture<bool>>>,
//!     call_status: &mut ::uniffi::RustCallStatus
//! ) {
//!     ::uniffi::ffi::uniffi_rustfuture_drop(future, call_status)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! First off, this _drop function_ is responsible to drop the `RustFuture`. It's
//! clear by looking at its signature: It receives a `Option<Box<RustFuture<_>>>`,
//! i.e. it takes ownership of the `RustFuture` _via_ `Box`!
//!
//! Similarly to the _poll function_, it forwards everything to
//! `uniffi_rustfuture_drop`, which is the generic version of the monomorphised _drop
//! function_.
//!
//! ## How `Future` works exactly?
//!
//! A [`Future`] in Rust does nothing. When calling an async function, it just
//! returns a `Future` but nothing has happened yet. To start the computation,
//! the future must be polled. It returns [`Poll::Ready(r)`][`Poll::Ready`] if
//! the result is ready, [`Poll::Pending`] otherwise. `Poll::Pending` basically
//! means:
//!
//! > Please, try to poll me later, maybe the result will be ready!
//!
//! This model is very different than what other languages do, but it can actually
//! be mangled quite easily, hopefully for us!
//!
//! But… wait a minute… who is responsible to poll the `Future` if a `Future` does
//! nothing? Well, it's _the executor_ (sometimes also called _the runtime_ but not
//! here). The executor is responsible _to drive_ the `Future`: that's where
//! they are polled.
//!
//! But… wait another minute… how the executor knows when to poll a [`Future`]?
//! Does it poll them randomly in a forever loop? Well, no, actually it depends
//! of the executor! A well-designed `Future` and executor work as follows.
//! Normally, when [`Future::poll`] is called, a [`Context`] argument is
//! passed to it. It contains a [`Waker`]. The [`Waker`] is built on top of a
//! [`RawWaker`] which implements whatever is necessary. Usually, a waker will
//! signal the executor to poll a particular `Future`. A `Future` will clone
//! or pass-by-ref the waker to somewhere, as a callback, a completion, a
//! function, or anything, to the system that is responsible to notify when a
//! task is completed. So, to recap, the waker is _not_ responsible to wake the
//! `Future`, it _is_ responsible to _signal_ the executor that a particular
//! `Future` must be polled again. That's why the documentation of
//! [`Poll::Pending`] specifies:
//!
//! > When a function returns `Pending`, the function must also ensure that the
//! > current task is scheduled to be awoken when progress can be made.
//!
//! “awoken” is done by using the `Waker`.
//!
//! ## Awaken from the foreign language land
//!
//! Our _poll function_ receives a waker function pointer, along with a waker
//! environment. We said that the waker function lives in the foreign language
//! land. That's really important. It cannot live inside Rust because Rust isn't
//! aware of which foreign language it is run from. It is UniFFI's job to
//! write a proper waker function, that will use the native foreign language's
//! executor provided by the language itself or by some common library (e.g.
//! `asyncio` in Python), to ask to poll the future again.
//!
//! ## The workflow
//!
//! 1. The foreign language starts by calling the regular FFI function
//!    `_uniffi_hello`. It gets an `Option<Box<RustFuture<_>>>`.
//!
//! 2. The foreign language polls the future by using the `_uniffi_hello_poll`
//!    function. It passes a function pointer to the waker function, implemented
//!    inside the foreign language, along with its environment if any.
//!
//!    - Either the future is ready and computes a value, in this case the _poll
//!      function_ will lift the value and will drop the future with the _drop function_
//!      (`_uniffi_hello_drop`),
//!
//!    - Either the future is pending (not ready), and is responsible to register
//!      the waker (as explained above).
//!
//! 3. When the waker is called, it calls the _poll function_, so we basically jump
//!    to point 2 of this list.
//!
//! There is an important subtlety though. Imagine the following Rust code:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let mut shared_state: MutexGuard<_> = a_shared_state.lock().unwrap();
//!
//! if let Some(waker) = shared_state.waker.take() {
//!     waker.wake();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This code will call the waker. That's nice and all. However, when the waker
//! function is called by `waker.wake()`, this code above has not returned yet.
//! And the waker function, as designed so far, will call the _poll function_
//! on the Rust side, which… may use the same lock (`a_shared_state`), which
//! is not released yet: there is a dead-lock! Rust is not responsible of that,
//! kind of. Rust **must ignore how the executor works**, all `Future`s are
//! executor- agnostic by design. To avoid creating problem, the waker must
//! “cut” the flow, so that Rust code can continue to run as expected, and
//! after that, the _poll function_ must be called.
//!
//! Put it differently, the waker function must call the _poll function_ _as
//! soon as possible_, not _immediately_. It actually makes sense: The waker
//! must signal the executor to schedule a poll for a specific `Future` when
//! possible; it's not an inline operation. The implementation of the waker
//! must be very careful of that.
//!
//! With a diagram (because this comment would look so much clever with a diagram),
//! it looks like this:
//!
//! ```text
