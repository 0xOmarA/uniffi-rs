It is the basis for all callbacks interfaces. It is registered exactly once per callback interface, at library start up time. Calling this method is only done by generated objects which mirror callback interfaces objects in the foreign language. The `handle` is the key into a handle map on the other side of the FFI used to look up the foreign language object that implements the callback interface/trait. The `method` selector specifies the method that will be called on the object, by looking it up in a list of methods from the IDL. The index is 1 indexed. Note that the list of methods is generated by at uniffi from the IDL and used in all bindings: so we can rely on the method list being stable within the same run of uniffi."]]});
